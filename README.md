BASIC SPEECH RECOGNITION
Aim 
 To build a simple speech recognition tool.
Description
 program that can recognize basic spoken commands or words. Use a pre
 trained model or a basic algorithm for speech recognition.
Technologies
 Python

PERSONALITY PREDICTION
Aim 
 To develop an AI-driven system that predicts an individual's personality traits by
 analyzing their Curriculum Vitae (CV) or resume.
Description
 This project aims to create a sophisticated personality prediction system that utilizes
 natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to analyze the
 textual content of CVs. The system will extract relevant information from resumes,
 such as educational background, work experience, skills, and achievements. By
 employing sentiment analysis, linguistic pattern recognition, and personality trait
 models, the system will predict personality characteristics like extroversion,
 conscientiousness, openness, agreeableness, and neuroticism.
Technologies
 Python, OpenCV, Deep reinforcement learning frameworks


NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING
Aim 
 To develop an AI system that can extract and summarize key legal information from
 complex legal documents.
Description
 advanced NLP techniques to process and understand legal language, and
 identify key clauses, and generate concise summaries.
Technologies
 Python, SpaCy, Transformers

FACIAL EMOTIONS DETECTION
Aim 
 To develop a system that can recognize and classify facial expressions in images or
 real-time video.
Description
 facial emotion detection model capable of identifying different emotions
 such as happiness, sadness, anger, etc., based on facial features. Utilize pre-trained
 models like CNNs (Convolutional Neural Networks) and datasets with labeled facial
 emotion expressions.
Technologies
 Python, OpenCV
